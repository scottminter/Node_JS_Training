- NVM
Node Version Manager

Let's you switch Node versions quickly and easily

- Installing various versions:
nvm install 8.6.* or nvm install 9.*

- Switch between them
nvm use 8.6.*



- NPM
Node Package Manger

Let's you install npm packages into your project or globally on your machine. 
When in doubt checkout the NPM page for the package to see what is recommended. 

- Save to project

npm install --save lodash

  - this installs it in the `node_module` directory and updates the `package.json` file
    so it's installed as a dependency

- Install globally
Use this for programs that need to be run from the command line like the Mocha 
testing suite.

npm install --global mocha

  - now you can run mocha commands from the command line



- Node -v
Node versioning is important and you will constantly be asked what version are you using. 
`node -v` is the quickest way to see that.
